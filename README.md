## Just11 Solver ðŸ§ 

### Project Overview

Just11 Solver is a Java application developed using JavaFX and Answer Set Programming (ASP) techniques to solve the Just11 game.

### What is Answer Set Programming (ASP)?

Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm that focuses on describing problem constraints rather than explicitly specifying algorithms. It utilizes a rule-based language to represent the problem's logic and searches for a set of rules (answer set) that satisfies all the specified constraints.

### Technology Stack

* Java and JavaFX: to develop the game. 
* Answer Set Programming (ASP): to formulate and solve the game's logic.

### Project Goals

1. To develop the Just11 game.

2. To implement Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a means of modeling and solving the game's complex logic.

### Project Methodology

The Just11 Solver project was developed using an iterative approach, involving the following steps:

1. **Problem Analysis:** Thoroughly understanding the rules and complexities of the Just11 game.

2. **ASP Formulation:** Translating the game's logic into ASP rules and constraints.

3. **ASP Solver Integration:** Integrating an ASP solver into the Java application to handle the problem-solving process.

4. **Testing and Refinement:** Rigorously testing the application to ensure its correctness and refining the ASP formulation as needed.
